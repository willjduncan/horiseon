# Code Refactor Starter Code

## <Horiseon>

## Description

Horiseon is a website designed to teach potential clients about what Horiseon does and how it manages to make clients' websites as effective on the web as possible. 

My job is to edit the CSS and HTML of Horiseon's website so that it better meets accessiblity standards. Thus, 

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code

THEN I find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the image elements

THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes

THEN they fall in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element

THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

By accomplishing these goals, developers will be able to understand the code better, and the content will be more accesible to those with disabilities. Such considerations will allow for easier coding in the future, if new pages and content must be added, and it will increase the SEO of the website. 

Before the edits were done, there were a lot of div elements that made the code unclear, and a lot of repetitive styles being used in CSS. Furthermore, one of the links in the navigation page was broken, and there were no alt descriptions for the images. 

Through the project, I applied the lessons learned in module 1 on the importance of semantic elements within HTML. I figured out how to use classes in a way that minimizes the amount of code typed within CSS. I also reorganized elements so that they proceeded in a logical way that complimented the HTML layout without compromising any of the visual elements already in place. I also made extensive use of the comment system to tell the reader what changes I made, as well as to show where one section ends and another begins. The distinction between the two comment types can be seen through the use of All Caps. 

Now, the website works even better than it used to, and can serve more easily as a template or something to grow from in the future. 

## Installation

First, I pulled the assignment from the GitHub link listed on Boot Camp Spot. From there, I created a challenges folder, made a challenge-1 folder within it, and there placed the pulled assignment. 

Then, I created my own repository on GitHub named Horiseon, and pushed everything I pulled into this new repository. The link to this repository is below.

[https://github.com/willjduncan/horiseon.git](https://github.com/willjduncan/horiseon.git)


 I had to make some adjustments to the files, removing the Develop file and adding a README file, so that when someone uses the link: 

[https://willjduncan.github.io/horiseon/](https://willjduncan.github.io/horiseon/)

it would open up Horiseon rather than this README file. 

## Usage

The mock-up, whose look should not and did not differ from the final product, is shown below

You can use the new, clean code as a template in case a new page needs to be added to the website, or as an example to show new coders what good code looks like. An example of the edited code is below. Note the alternate text, the comments, and the semantic HTML elements.

## Credits

No classmates or instructors were used in the making of this website. The coding boot camp Professional README Guide found at https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide was used as a template for this README. The WHEN/THEN section of this README was taken directly from the homework assignment Acceptance Criteria. THe Run-Buddy project of Module 1 was used as an example to emulate as I organized Horiseon's website.  The license was picked from [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/), as suggested by the README Guide aforementioned.
