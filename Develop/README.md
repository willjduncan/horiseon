# Code Refactor Starter Code

# <Horiseon>

## Description

Horiseon is a website designed to teach potential clients about what Horiseon does and how it manages to make clients' websites as effective on the web as possible. 

My job is to edit the CSS and HTML of Horiseon's website so that it better meets accessiblity standards. Thus, 

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

By accomplishing these goals, developers will be able to understand the code better, and the content will be more accesible to those with disabilities. Such considerations will allow for easier coding in the future, if new pages and content must be added, and it will increase the SEO of the website. 

Before the edits were done, there were a lot of div elements that made the code unclear, and a lot of repetitive styles being used in CSS. Furthermore, one of the links in the navigation page was broken, and there were no alt descriptions for the images. 

Through the project, I applied the lessons learned in module 1 on the importance of semantic elements within HTML. I figured out how to use classes in a way that minimizes the amount of code typed within CSS. I also reorganized elements so that they proceeded in a logical way that complimented the HTML layout without compromising any of the visual elements already in place. I also made extensive use of the comment system to tell the reader what changes I made, as well as to show where one section ends and another begins. The distinction between the two comment types can be seen through the use of All Caps. 

Now, the website works even better than it used to, and can serve more easily as a template or something to grow from in the future.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
